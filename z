[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32m### `npm run build`[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mBuilds the app for production to the `build` folder.\[m
[32m+[m[32mIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\[m
[32m+[m[32mYour app is ready to be deployed![m

[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32m### `npm run eject`[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32m**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mIf you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32mYou donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.[m
